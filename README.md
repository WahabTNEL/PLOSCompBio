Code and data associated with the manuscript submitted to PLOS Comp Bio titled "Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Human High Gamma Discriminate Naturalistic Behavioral States"

To reconstruct Figures 1a and 1b, run VisualizationExamples.m

To reconstruct Figures 2a and 2b, run 'NYU Code/ClassifyallStatic_NYU.m' and 'RCH Code/ClassifyAllStatic_RCH.m'.

To reconstruct Figures 3a and 3b, run 'NYU Code/GeneratePSDs_NYU.m' and 'RCH Code/GeneratePSDs_RCH.m'

To reconstruct Figures 4a and 4b, run 'NYU Code/ErrorvsDim_NYU.m' and 'RCH Code/ErrorvsDim_RCH.m'

To reconstruct Figures 5a-b and 6a-b, 'NYU Code/run GPFA_NYU_FactorDecoding.m' and 'RCH Code/GPFA_RCH_FactorDecoding.m'

To reconstruct Figure 7b and 7d, run 'VisualizeFactorWeights.m'

To reconstruct Figure 8, run 'NYU Code/Visualize_Fastest_vs_Slowest.m'

 Note that slight differences might occur between published figures and generated figures due to the random sampling of the testing and training sets, but overall trends are the same. Random sampling effects Figures 2,4,5,6,7,8.
