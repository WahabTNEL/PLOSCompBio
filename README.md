Code and data associated with the manuscript submitted to PLOS Comp Bio titled "Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Human High Gamma Discriminate Naturalistic Behavioral States"


To reconstruct Figures 2a and 2b, run ClassifyallStatic_NYU.m and ClassifyAllStatic_RCH.m.

To reconstruct Figures 3a and 3b, run GeneratePSDs_NYU.m and GeneratePSDs_RCH.m

To reconstruct Figures 4a and 4b, run ErrorvsDim_NYU.m and ErrorvsDim_RCH.m

To reconstruct Figures 5a-b and 6a-b, run GPFA_NYU_FactorDecoding.m and GPFA_RCH_FactorDecodimg.m

To reconstruct Figure 7b and 7d, run VisualizeFactorWeights.m

To reconstruct Figure 8, run Visualize_Fastest_vs_Slowest.m

 Note that slight differences might occur between published figures and generated figures due to the random sampling of the testing and training sets, but overall trends are the same. Random sampling is applied to Figures 3,4,5,6,7,8.
